# Welcome to my first Milestone project.

## Specialised Transport Training (S.T.T)

STT was an real driving school which wound up in 2007.

I had been an instructor at the school for about six years up to 2004. 

Geoff O'Brien was the owner / proprieter of the school and he has given me permission to use the business name and even supplied me with photos of some of the training vehicles we used.
